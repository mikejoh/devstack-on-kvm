# Devstack on KVM

Deploy [Devstack](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/) on KVM! üöÄ

_For those occastions when you want to test things against OpenStack (APIs) but you don't want to use the one(s) in production._ üòè

## ‚úÖ Pre-requisites

* KVM
* OpenTofu (the `terraform` fork)

## üóíÔ∏è Important notes

TODO: Add notes

## üèÉ Getting started

TODO: Provide a proper explaination on how to allow traffic to and from VM via `ufw` (if this is enabled for the user)

### Provision cluster nodes

1. Change the `devstack.auto.tfvars` to fit your needs!
2. Run `tofu init`
3. Run `tofu plan`
4. Run `tofu apply`
5. The needed nodes shall be provisioned with everything included for you to start bootstrapping the cluster.

### Accessing the nodes

_Remember to start your VMs after a reboot, they'll be shut off by default. Run `sudo virsh start` for each VM!_

#### SSH to one node a time

To find out the IP addresses of the VMs you can run the following using `virsh`:

```bash
sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases devstack_net
```

#### SSH using the provided helper script

This requires that you have [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed.

```bash
PRIVATE_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/devstack scripts/ssh.sh
```

_Make sure you're using the private key that matches the public key added as part of the cluster node provisioning. We're adding a user called `cloud` by default that has the provided public key as one of the `ssh_authorized_keys`._

#### Using `tmux` and `xpanes` to SSH to all available nodes

Don't forget to inline the private key path below and replace `<PRIVATE_KEY>` before running the command:

```bash
tmux

sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases devstack_net | tail -n +3 | awk '{print $5 }' | cut -d"/" -f1 | xpanes -l ev -c 'ssh -l cloud -i <PRIVATE_KEY> {}'
```

### Clean up

Use the provided `clean_up.sh` script in the `scripts/` directory.

### Todo

* Create a `stack` user, problems with `/opt/stack` otherwise, use provided script or create a user manually.
* Investigate why the `/opt/stack/requirements` directory were empty
* Row 60 and below in the cloud-init file!
