# DevStack on KVM

Deploy [DevStack](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/) on KVM! üöÄ

_For those occasions when you want to test things against OpenStack (APIs) but you don't want to use the one(s) in production._ üòè

## ‚úÖ Pre-requisites

* KVM
* OpenTofu (the `terraform` fork)

## üóíÔ∏è Important notes

* It'll take some time for the DevStack installation to complete, please run `sudo virsh console devstack01` to follow the installation. Press `Ctrl+5` to exit the console. Please note that we're installing Octavia with everything included (like building of the Octavia worker image), so please be patient.
* Before starting, stop `ufw` temporarily if it's running locally, i haven't found a good combination of FW rules yet.
* Info on how to perform configuration customization when installing DevStack check [this](https://github.com/openstack/devstack/blob/master/doc/source/configuration.rst) out.

## üèÉ Getting started

### Provision cluster nodes

1. Change the `devstack.auto.tfvars` to fit your needs!
2. Run `tofu init`
3. Run `tofu plan`
4. Run `tofu apply`
5. The needed nodes shall be provisioned with everything included for you to start bootstrapping the cluster.

To see the progress of the DevStack installation, run the following command:

```bash
sudo virsh console devstack01
```

### Accessing the DevStack environment

_Remember to start your VMs after a reboot, they'll be shut off by default. Run `sudo virsh start` for each VM!_

#### Browse to the DevStack dashboard

Open your browser and go to the following URL:

```bash
http://<devstack01-ip>/
```

To find out the IP addresses of the VMs you can run the following using `virsh`:

```bash
sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases devstack_net
```

The DevStack dashboard (Horizon) can be logged into using the following credentials:

```
Username: demo
Password: secret
```

#### SSH to the DevStack instance

This requires that you have [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed.

```bash
PRIVATE_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/devstack scripts/ssh.sh
```

_Make sure you're using the private key that matches the public key added as part of the cluster node provisioning. We're adding a user called `cloud` by default that has the provided public key as one of the `ssh_authorized_keys`._

Run this to generate a new SSH key pair, make sure to point to the public key and it's path in the `tfvars` file:

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "devstack-kvm" -f ~/.ssh/devstack
```

#### Using `tmux` and `xpanes` to SSH to all available nodes

Don't forget to inline the private key path below and replace `<PRIVATE_KEY>` before running the command:

```bash
tmux

sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases devstack_net | tail -n +3 | awk '{print $5 }' | cut -d"/" -f1 | xpanes -l ev -c 'ssh -l cloud -i <PRIVATE_KEY> {}'
```

### How to reach the public IP address range in DevStack

In DevStack the `public` network will have the following range by default: `172.24.4.0/24`.

1. Enable proxy arp in the `devstack01` VM primary interface:

```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ens3/proxy_arp
```

_Please note that my interface were named `ens3`._

2. Associating floating IPs to e.g. Loadbalancers or instances
3. Update security groups if needed, i had to allow more in the `default` security group (created automatically)
4. Update your local routing table, i needed to do the following:

```
sudo ip route add 172.24.4.0/24 dev virbr1
```

`virbr1` was the bridge that my `devstack01` VM was connected to as of writing this.

### Troubleshooting

#### DevStack logs

Checking logs:

```
journalctl -f -u devstack@*
journalctl -f -u devstack@<service>
```

#### Various encountered errors and problems

When updating (increasing) the `image_size_total` in Glance via the `openstack` CLI the following where seen in the `g-api` logs:

```
Unhandled error: oslo_db.exception.DBDeadlock: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (1205, 'Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction')
```

Fixed by restarting the `mysql` service in the DevStack VM.

### Clean up

Run `tofu destroy`.
